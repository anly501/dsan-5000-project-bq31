    <h1>Data Cleaning for Data Science Project</h1>
    <p>This section provides a detailed overview of our data cleaning processes, as required by HW-2.2.</p>

    <h2>Overview of Data Cleaning</h2>
    <p>Data cleaning is a crucial step in preparing our data for analysis. This process includes handling missing values, correcting data formats, and ensuring data integrity.</p>

    <h3>Python Data Cleaning</h3>
    <p>Our Python script, Data_Cleaning.py, is used for cleaning text data and includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <!-- Summarize specific methods used in the Python script for data cleaning -->
    </ul>

    <h3>R Data Cleaning</h3>
    <p>R scripts are utilized for cleaning record data with both qualitative and quantitative variables. Specific steps include:</p>
    <ul>
        <!-- Outline specific R data cleaning methods here -->
    </ul>

    <h2>Code and Data Transparency</h2>
    <p>All cleaning steps are transparent, and the codes are accessible for replication. Below are links to our scripts and cleaned datasets:</p>
